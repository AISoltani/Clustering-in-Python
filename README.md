## Welcome to Clustering (Theory & Code)

### 01 Unsupervised Learning (Theory)
* What is Unsupervised Learning & Goals of Unsupervised Learning 
* Type of Unsupervised Learning - 1.Clustering, 2.Association Rule & 3.Dimensionality Reduction

### 02 Clustering (Theory)
* Definition and Application of Clustering
* 3 Types of Clustering - 1.K Means 2.Hierarchical & 3.DBScan Clustering

### 03 K-Means Clustering (Theory)
* How Algorithim works (Step Wise Calculation)
* Pre-processing required for K Means
* Determining optimal number of K - 1. Profiling Approach & 2. Elbow Method

### 04 Elbow Method (Theory)
* Working of Elbow Method with Example
* 3 concepts - 1.Total Error, 2.Variance/Total Squared Error & 3.Within Cluster Sum of Square (WCSS)

### 05 K Means Clustering (Python Code)
* Preparing the Data
* Elbow Method and K Means Clustering in Python
