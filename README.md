## Welcome to Clustering (Theory & Code)

### 01 Unsupervised Learning (Theory)
* What is Unsupervised Learning & Goals of Unsupervised Learning 
* Type of Unsupervised Learning: 1.Clustering, 2.Association Rule & 3.Dimensionality Reduction

### 02 Clustering (Theory)
* Definition and Application of Clustering
* 3 Types of Clustering: 1.K Means 2.Hierarchical & 3.DBScan Clustering

### 03 Euclidean & Manhattan Distance (Theory)
* Two points are near to each other, chances they are similar
* Distance Measure between two points
  1. Euclidean Distance: Under-root of Square distance between two points
  2. Manhattan Distance: Absolute Distance between points 

### 04 K-Means Clustering (Theory)
* How Algorithim works (Step Wise Calculation)
* Pre-processing required for K Means
* Determining optimal number of K: 1.Profiling Approach & 2.Elbow Method

### 05 Elbow Method (Theory)
* Working of Elbow Method with Example
* 3 concepts: 1.Total Error, 2.Variance/Total Squared Error & 3.Within Cluster Sum of Square (WCSS)

### 06 K Means Clustering (Python Code)
* Preparing the Data
* Elbow Method and K Means Clustering in Python

### 07 Hierarchical Clustering (Theory)
* Two Approaches: 1.Agglomerative(Botton-Up) & 2.Divisive(Top-Down)
* Types of Linkages: 
  1. Single Linkage - Nearest Neighbour
  2. Complete Linkage - Farthest Neighbour
  3. Average Linkage - Average Distance (Mean intercluster dissimilarity)
