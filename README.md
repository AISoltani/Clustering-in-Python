## Welcome to Clustering (Theory & Code)

### 01 Unsupervised Learning (Theory)
* What is Unsupervised Learning & Goals of Unsupervised Learning 
* Type of Unsupervised Learning - 1.Clustering, 2.Association Rule & 3.Dimensionality Reduction

### 02 Clustering (Theory)
* Definition and Application of Clustering
* Three Types of Clustering Methods
  1. K Means Clustering
  2. Hierarchical Clstering 
  3. DB Scan Clustering

### 03 K Means Clustering (Theory)
* How Algorithim works (Step Wise Calculation)
* Pre-processing required for K Means
* Determining optimal number of K - 1. Profiling Approach & 2. Elbow Method
